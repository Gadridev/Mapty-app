## the Goal for this application 
The goal of Mapty is to easily log your workouts. Simply click on the location on the map where you had a workout, and a special form with several fields will appear on the left side. Choose from options like running or cycling, fill in the distance and time, and press enter. The form will be replaced with a workout list, and you can even press on past workouts to move the map to that location.
